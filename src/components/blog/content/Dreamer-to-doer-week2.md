Hey there founder 👋

Welcome to **Week 2** of _From Dreamer to Doer_ — your 7-week series to help you stay focused, gain clarity, and grow what you’re building with confidence.

Last week, you built a calendar that works even on your messiest days.  
This week, we’re dialing in on **who you’re building for** — so your business stops feeling like a guessing game and starts pulling in the right people.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

You wouldn’t pitch a product to “everyone.”  
And yet, most early-stage founders unintentionally do exactly that.

If you don’t know who your dream client is — what they want, what’s holding them back, and how they talk about their struggles — you’re building in the dark.

We’re fixing that today.

## 🛠️ Your 2-Step Ideal Client Sprint

### Step 1: Fill Out This Quick Profile

You don’t need a 20-page research doc.  
You just need to know your ideal client like a close friend.

✅ **Ideal Client Quick Sheet (1 Page)**  
Fill this out — or drop it into your note-taking app of choice:

| Field             | Prompt                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**         | Give them a real name. It sharpens your message.                       |
| **Age**          | Be specific — 23 is not the same as 33.                                |
| **Occupation**   | Full-time, freelance, in-between? What do they do now?                 |
| **Lifestyle**    | What’s a typical day or week like for them? Busy, flexible, chaotic?   |
| **Situation**    | Are they stuck in a job? Building something on the side?               |
| **Hobbies**      | Podcasts? Workouts? Walks? What do they enjoy?                         |
| **Personal**     | Single? Partnered? Kids? Living at home?                               |
| **Finances**     | What are they spending on? What’s stressing them out financially?      |
| **Pain Points**  | Where are they stuck or frustrated right now?                          |
| **Emotional Drivers** | What do they want deep down? Recognition? Freedom? Confidence? |

## Step 2: Reality Check Your Idea

- Would this feel like a “nice to have” — or a “yes, finally” solution?
