Hey there founder 👋

Welcome to **Week 3** of _From Dreamer to Doer_ — the halfway point of your 7-week sprint to build momentum that sticks.

This week, we’re shifting from clarity to action.  
You're going to build your **Minimum Viable Offer** — a small, focused solution your dream client will actually say yes to.

And no, it doesn’t need to be perfect.  
It just needs to solve a real problem in a real way — so you can get feedback, earn trust, and build fast.

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Too many early founders waste months building products no one buys.

Let’s skip that.

You’re going to validate the idea first — by crafting an offer that’s **valuable**, **simple**, and **easy to test**.

## 🛠️ Your 3-Step MVP Sprint

### Step 1: Ask, “What Would Make Them Say Yes?”

Pull out the Ideal Client Profile you created last week.  
Now ask:

- What would they be excited to pay for — right now, in their current situation?

Need help? Use ChatGPT to test it:

```text
Act like my ideal client. Here’s their profile: [insert]. What kind of offer would feel like a clear ‘yes’?
```

Keep prompting it until it gives you something you’d *actually* buy if you were them.

---

### Step 2: Make It Ridiculously Easy to Launch

Imagine you’re at 20% energy, no time, and no money.

How could you test this idea anyway?

Try:

- A quick “Coming Soon” waitlist page with an email signup  
- A DM post in a Facebook or Discord group  
- A simple form or link in your Instagram bio  
- A short video explaining what you're working on  

💡 **The goal:** Get real interest *before* you build too much.

---

### Step 3: Build the Offer *with* Your Ideal Client

Once you have a rough idea + a platform to share it — build with your client, not for them.

Ask ChatGPT to play the role of your dream client and help shape:

- The offer name  
- The promise/result  
- The format (PDF, call, template, workshop, Notion system)  
- The price  

Refine it until your ideal client sees it as the exact help they’ve been looking for — and you feel excited to deliver it.

> And remember: No sales = feedback too.  
> That’s what this phase is for.
