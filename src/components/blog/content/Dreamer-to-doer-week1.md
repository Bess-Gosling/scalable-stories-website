Hey there founder 👋

Welcome to **Week 1** of our _From Dreamer to Doer_ series.

Over the next 7 weeks, we’re giving you clear, simple steps to build momentum, stay focused, and start scaling your business — even when life gets busy.

If you're balancing a full-time job, a growing side hustle, and about a million ideas — it’s way too easy to let your time slip away without noticing.

This week, **we're fixing that.**

We’re designing your **Founder Calendar** — a simple, flexible plan that works even when you're low on energy _(because real life gets messy)._  

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Most founders plan for their best selves — not their tired, distracted, "I’ll do it later" selves.

We're building a calendar that respects your real energy, protects your dream, and keeps momentum moving even on rough days.

## 🛠️ Your 5-Step Founder Calendar

### Step 1: Track your time for one normal week
📝 Yes, even the YouTube deep dives and Netflix marathons.

### Step 2: Audit it
- How much was productive work?
- How much was genuine recharge time?
- How much was just... wasted?

### Step 3: Design your Ideal Lazy Week
📅 Plan assuming you're only operating at 50% energy.  
If your plan survives lazy days, it’ll thrive on great ones.

### Step 4: Block 1 Hour of CEO Time
💡 What’s CEO Time?
> It’s a protected hour each week where you work **on** your business — not just **in** it.  
Strategy, goals, bottlenecks, future plans.

It’s how you grow intentionally, not accidentally.

### Step 5: Test and Tweak
⚡ Try it for a week. Adjust. Repeat. Build momentum, not perfection.
